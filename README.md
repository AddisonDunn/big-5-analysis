# Finding Deeper Patterns within the Big Five Personality Traits

## Navigation

You will see folders with names such as "clustering" and a folder named "linear_reg". These are all various approaches/analysis of the data. You are welcome to explore!

Each folder will include a .ipynb file. This is where the action happens. You'll also see .py files, which are imported modules with helper methods. Then you might see some .html file with visualizations.

Data can be found in the "Big-5-Data" folder. A description of the data and what they mean can be found in the file "codebook.txt".

## What are the "Big 5"?
The [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) is the set of personality traits most commonly agreed upon by modern psychologists. All adjectives used to describe human character were essentially boiled down into five categories (using data analysis :)). The Big Five combined with IQ account for all significant variance between humans in terms of behavior.
